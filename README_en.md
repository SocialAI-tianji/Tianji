Tianji is a free, non-commercial artificial intelligence system. You can utilize it for tasks involving worldly wisdom, such as "art of conversation," to enhance your emotional intelligence and core competitiveness. We firmly believe that worldly wisdom are the future core competency of AI, and let us join hands to witness the advent of general artificial intelligence.

## What You Will Learn in Tianji üçâ

- Build [prompt](./tianji/prompt/gpt_prompt/) dialogue [large model applications](./run/tianji_prompt_webui.py)

- Create [AI games](./tianji/prompt/aigame/zhipu/) (similar to coaxing simulator) applications

- Build [intelligent agent applications](./run/metagpt_webui.py) based on [metagpt](./tianji/agents/metagpt_agents/) (to be refactored soon)

- Build a [knowledge base dialogue application](./tianji/knowledges/) from scratch (to be refactored soon)

- [Create data from scratch](./docs/finetune/how-to-get-finetune-data.md), [fine-tune](./docs/finetune/how-to-get-finetune-data.md) your own large language model

**After completing all the content, you will gain entry-level full-stack application development capabilities for large language models. üï∂Ô∏è**

[SocialAI](https://socialai-tianji.github.io/socialai-web/) is a non-profit organization established in China. We have fully open-sourced the **Tianji** series of work. The current open-source system technology route involves [Prompt](tianji/prompt/yiyan_prompt), [AI games](test/prompt/aigame/zhipu), [Agent](tianji/agents), knowledge base, [model training](docs/finetune/tianji-wishes-chinese.md). For specific content, please refer to the documentation and corresponding repositories.

Based on the organized social etiquette data, the social etiquette large model system - Tianji includes seven major areas of common interpersonal communication (specific details can be found in the scenario refinement details in [Scene Classification](test/%E5%9C%BA%E6%99%AF%E5%88%86%E7%B1%BB)), which can be broadly divided into:

```
- Toasting etiquette culture Etiquette
- Hospitality etiquette culture Hospitality
- Gift-giving etiquette culture Gifting
- Sending blessings Wishes
- How to speak Communication
- Resolving "awkward" situations Awkwardness
- Dealing with conflicts & confrontations Conflict
```

Combining these areas, Tianji involves four technical routes:

- Pure prompt (including AI games): Built-in system prompt based on the large model's own ability to dialogue.
- Agent (MetaGPT, etc.): Using Agent architecture to get richer, more customized detailed answers.
- Knowledge base: Directly retrieve social etiquette rules (such as how to drink at the dinner table).
- Model training: Based on different excellent model bases, perform Lora fine-tuning or full fine-tuning when accumulating a large amount of data.

You can find the corresponding source code for the four routes in the tianji directory. If you want to refer to the project architecture, data management, and technical route of `Tianji` to recreate your own vertical domain AI application, welcome to fork or directly refer to it. We will open source all processes including `project start-up, data direction exploration, data construction and management, AI application creation from scratch, in-depth combination of domain (such as social etiquette) and technical routes`; we hope to see further acceleration of AI native applications in life.

## üì∞News

- **\[2024.07.14\]** Updated the new [Sending Blessings module](https://openxlab.org.cn/apps/detail/tackhwa00/Tianji-Wishes) supporting more style switches, data open-sourced to [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sanbu/tianji-chinese/blob/main/tianji-wishes-chinese-v0.1.json)

- **\[2024.05.04\]** üöÄ We released a [fine-tuning data acquisition and production tutorial](https://github.com/SocialAI-tianji/Tianji/blob/main/docs/finetune/how-to-get-finetune-data.md) using "Resolving Awkward Situations" as an example, with corresponding data open-sourced to [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sanbu/tianji-chinese/tree/main)

## Running Environment

### Environment Installation

Due to differing environment dependencies between the agent and RAG, installing both at the same time may cause version conflicts.

If you want to run the agent version, please run the following command to install the environment:

```
pip install -e .[agent]
```

If you want to run the RAG version, please run the following command to install the environment:

```
pip install -e .[rag]
```

### Key Configuration

To ensure the project runs normally, **please create a new `.env` file in the project and set your API keys in it**. You can write the corresponding keys according to the following example to successfully run the call. Currently, zhipuai is used by default, so you can just write `ZHIPUAI_API_KEY` to use it.

If you encounter extremely slow or unable to download issues when downloading models from Hugging Face, please set the value of `HF_ENDPOINT` to `https://hf-mirror.com` in the .env file. Please note that some Hugging Face repositories may require access permission (e.g., Jina Ai). For this, please register a Hugging Face account and add `HF_TOKEN` in the .env file. You can find and obtain your token [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_API_BASE=
ZHIPUAI_API_KEY=
BAIDU_API_KEY=
OPENAI_API_MODEL=
HF_HOME='./cache/'
HF_ENDPOINT = 'https://hf-mirror.com'
HF_TOKEN=
```

## File Directory Description

```
assets/: Static image files
run/: Includes various demonstration frontends
test/: This contains test files for various functions, including core modules and llm runtime unit tests
tianji/: Source code directory, containing main logic and algorithm implementations
tools/: Tools to help collect data, organize data cleaning corpus
```

### Documentation Description

TODO, to cover all documentation

## üç∫How to Run

The following provides the application methods for prompt and agent. Before running, please make sure you have created a `.env` file:

```bash
# Run prompt webui frontend
python3 run/tianji_prompt_webui.py

# Run agent frontend
streamlit run run/metagpt_webui.py
```

## Examples

### Fine-tuning - Blessing Module

The current blessing module supports three modes of triggering:

Normal style, directly write the blessing recipient, conforming to common conversation patterns.
Xiaohongshu style, can be triggered by adding "Xiaohongshu style" after specifying the blessing recipient; comes with emojis and cute conversation style.
Serious style, can be triggered by adding "serious style" after specifying the blessing recipient; formal writing style.

### Prompt - How to Make a Toast

Here's a dialogue example of Tesla founder Elon Musk toasting to OpenAI founder Sam Altman (generated based on built-in prompts):

```
elon musk: Sam, your Openai should be called CloseAI instead
sam altman: You better manage your grok first, I'm punishing you with three drinks!
elon musk: Look at what you're saying, do you want me to finish this bottle of baijiu?
sam altman: Haha, Elon, you're a man aiming for the stars and seas, what's a bottle of baijiu? I heard you even dare to drink rocket fuel at SpaceX parties! Come on, I'll finish this glass, you do as you please, but don't lose the dignity of the world's richest man!
elon musk: You're challenging me, brother Sam! Well, I won't be polite then, I'll drink it, you take half a glass. But speaking of which, OpenAI's achievements aren't just about boasting, you better keep an eye on it, don't let it really become "CloseAI".
sam altman: Hey, I'm always ready to take off this CEO hat and let you wear it, old Musk. But tonight, let's forget about all that, come on, let's toast to our friendship! I'll finish it, you do as you please, but remember, we still have to continue changing the world tomorrow!
elon musk: Alright, just for your "changing the world" phrase, I'll finish this glass! But don't think I'll let you off easily, wait until I bring my Tesla charging pile next time, see how you deal with that!
sam altman: Haha, I'm looking forward to that day! But for now, let's enjoy tonight. Come on, last glass, I'll finish it, you do as you please, drink happily, don't forget, OpenAI's AIs are still waiting for us to go back and continue training them!
```

## How to Replicate This Project

The initial intention of this project is, first, to make `AI learn core technology`, and second, to allow more people (domains/industries) to build their own AI systems, accelerating AI's penetration into every field. You can learn about this project through the following ways:

You can refer to this project to create new vertical domain applications:

- Rental assistant (agent)
- Childcare assistant (data collection and knowledge base)
- Life guide (data collection and knowledge base)
