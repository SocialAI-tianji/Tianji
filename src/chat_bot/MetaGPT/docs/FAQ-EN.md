5.  ### FAQ

<!---->

1.  Experience with the generated repo code:

    1.  https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT/releases/tag/v0.1.0

1.  Code truncation/ Parsing failure:

    1.  Check if it's due to exceeding length. Consider using the gpt-3.5-turbo-16k or other long token versions.

1.  Success rate:

    1.  There hasn't been a quantitative analysis yet, but the success rate of code generated by GPT-4 is significantly higher than that of gpt-3.5-turbo.

1.  Support for incremental, differential updates (if you wish to continue a half-done task):

    1.  Several prerequisite tasks are listed on the ROADMAP.

1.  Can existing code be loaded?

    1.  It's not on the ROADMAP yet, but there are plans in place. It just requires some time.

1.  Support for multiple programming languages and natural languages?

    1.  It's listed on ROADMAP.

1.  Want to join the contributor team? How to proceed?

    1.  Merging a PR will get you into the contributor's team. The main ongoing tasks are all listed on the ROADMAP.

1.  PRD stuck / unable to access/ connection interrupted

    1.  The official OPENAI_API_BASE address is `https://api.openai.com/v1`
    1.  If the official OPENAI_API_BASE address is inaccessible in your environment (this can be verified with curl), it's recommended to configure using the reverse proxy OPENAI_API_BASE provided by libraries such as openai-forward. For instance, `OPENAI_API_BASE: "``https://api.openai-forward.com/v1``"`
    1.  If the official OPENAI_API_BASE address is inaccessible in your environment (again, verifiable via curl), another option is to configure the OPENAI_PROXY parameter. This way, you can access the official OPENAI_API_BASE via a local proxy. If you don't need to access via a proxy, please do not enable this configuration; if accessing through a proxy is required, modify it to the correct proxy address. Note that when OPENAI_PROXY is enabled, don't set OPENAI_API_BASE.
    1.  Note: OpenAI's default API design ends with a v1. An example of the correct configuration is: `OPENAI_API_BASE: "``https://api.openai.com/v1``"`

1.  Absolutely! How can I assist you today?

    1.  Did you use Chi or a similar service? These services are prone to errors, and it seems that the error rate is higher when consuming 3.5k-4k tokens in GPT-4

1.  What does Max token mean?

    1.  It's a configuration for OpenAI's maximum response length. If the response exceeds the max token, it will be truncated.

1.  How to change the investment amount?

    1.  You can view all commands by typing `python startup.py --help`

1.  Which version of Python is more stable?

    1.  python3.9 / python3.10

1.  Can't use GPT-4, getting the error "The model gpt-4 does not exist."

    1.  OpenAI's official requirement: You can use GPT-4 only after spending $1 on OpenAI.
    1.  Tip: Run some data with gpt-3.5-turbo (consume the free quota and $1), and then you should be able to use gpt-4.

1.  Can games whose code has never been seen before be written?

    1.  Refer to the README. The recommendation system of Toutiao is one of the most complex systems in the world currently. Although it's not on GitHub, many discussions about it exist online. If it can visualize these, it suggests it can also summarize these discussions and convert them into code. The prompt would be something like "write a recommendation system similar to Toutiao". Note: this was approached in earlier versions of the software. The SOP of those versions was different; the current one adopts Elon Musk's five-step work method, emphasizing trimming down requirements as much as possible.

1.  Under what circumstances would there typically be errors?

    1.  More than 500 lines of code: some function implementations may be left blank.
    1.  When using a database, it often gets the implementation wrong — since the SQL database initialization process is usually not in the code.
    1.  With more lines of code, there's a higher chance of false impressions, leading to calls to non-existent APIs.

1.  Instructions for using SD Skills/UI Role:

    1.  Currently, there is a test script located in /tests/metagpt/roles. The file ui_role provides the corresponding code implementation. For testing, you can refer to the test_ui in the same directory.

    1.  The UI role takes over from the product manager role, extending the output from the 【UI Design draft】 provided by the product manager role. The UI role has implemented the UIDesign Action. Within the run of UIDesign, it processes the respective context, and based on the set template, outputs the UI. The output from the UI role includes:

        1.  UI Design Description: Describes the content to be designed and the design objectives.
        1.  Selected Elements： Describes the elements in the design that need to be illustrated.
        1.  HTML Layout： Outputs the HTML code for the page.
        1.  CSS Styles (styles.css)： Outputs the CSS code for the page.

    1.  Currently, the SD skill is a tool invoked by UIDesign. It instantiates the SDEngine, with specific code found in metagpt/tools/sd_engine.

    1.  Configuration instructions for SD Skills: The SD interface is currently deployed based on *https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui* **For environmental configurations and model downloads, please refer to the aforementioned GitHub repository. To initiate the SD service that supports API calls, run the command specified in cmd with the parameter nowebui, i.e.,

        1.  > python webui.py --enable-insecure-extension-access --port xxx --no-gradio-queue --nowebui
        1.      Once it runs without errors, the interface will be accessible after approximately 1 minute when the model finishes loading.
        1.  Configure SD_URL and SD_T2I_API in the config.yaml/key.yaml files.
        1.  ![](https://p3-juejin.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-k3u1fbpfcp/065295a67b0b4feea665d1372722d49d~tplv-k3u1fbpfcp-zoom-1.image)
        1.      SD_URL is the deployed server/machine IP, and Port is the specified port above, defaulting to 7860.
        1.  > SD_URL: IP:Port

1.  An error occurred during installation: "Another program is using this file...egg".

    1.  Delete the file and try again.
    1.  Or manually execute`pip install -r requirements.txt`

1.  The origin of the name MetaGPT？

    1.  The name was derived after iterating with GPT-4 over a dozen rounds. GPT-4 scored and suggested it.

1.  Is there a more step-by-step installation tutorial?

1.  openai.error.RateLimitError: You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details

    1.  If you haven't exhausted your free quota, set RPM to 3 or lower in the settings.
    1.  If your free quota is used up, consider adding funds to your account.

1.  What does "borg" mean in n_borg?

    1.  [Wikipedia borg meaning ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg)
    1.  The Borg civilization operates based on a hive or collective mentality, known as "the Collective." Every Borg individual is connected to the collective via a sophisticated subspace network, ensuring continuous oversight and guidance for every member. This collective consciousness allows them to not only "share the same thoughts" but also to adapt swiftly to new strategies. While individual members of the collective rarely communicate, the collective "voice" sometimes transmits aboard ships.

1.  How to use the Claude API？

    1.  The full implementation of the Claude API is not provided in the current code.
    1.  You can use the Claude API through third-party API conversion projects like: https://github.com/jtsang4/claude-to-chatgpt

1.  Is Llama2 supported？

    1.  On the day Llama2 was released, some of the community members began experiments and found that output can be generated based on MetaGPT's structure. However, Llama2's context is too short to generate a complete project. Before regularly using Llama2, it's necessary to expand the context window to at least 8k. If anyone has good recommendations for expansion models or methods, please leave a comment.

1.  `mermaid-cli getElementsByTagName SyntaxError: Unexpected token '.'`

    1.  Upgrade node to version 14.x or above:

        1.  `npm install -g n`
        1.  `n stable` to install the stable version of node（v18.x）
